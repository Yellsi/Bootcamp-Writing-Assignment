#Reasons To Code

I initially wanted to be a coder because I used to watch movies and saw hackers doing whatever they were doing and thought that it was cool, but I now want to be a coder because I like seeing how the apps and little widgets we use everyday are made and we do almost everything on our phones so it would be cool to add a little bit to the evolution of technology and applications by developing some of the apps that make our lives easier and maybe provide solutions to some of the problems we as people face.
