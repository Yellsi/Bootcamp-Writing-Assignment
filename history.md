#My History

Hi, my name is Mthokozisi Msibi and I am from Lenasia South. My birthday is on the 23rd of December and I am the third of 4 boys. I started my schooling career at Houghton Primary School and then eventually went to Sandringham High School where I met some of my closest friends and spent some of the best years of my life. I played a bit of cricket, soccer and chess in primary and in high school I played a bit of rugby but didn’t really play a lot of sport in high school , and sometime in primary school I won a chess medal for the league we used to play at and our team came out second that year and we had won bronze the year before in a multi-district league. My dad’s family is originally from Ladysmith in KZN and my mom’s family is from North West and they met in Joburg while studying and working. I spent most of my holidays at my grandparents house in North West and that is the house that has most of the memories from when I was a child and where I spent most of my mischievous years.
